Load a file to SQS 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️

The goal here is to be the fastest file to SQS script out there and have a good time doing it.

## Project Roadmap

1. Iterate in this repo under version 0.0.1 with breaking changes whenever. If you want to use it, please just copy the script.
2. Once MVP has been reached, publish to NPM under version 0.x. Breaking changes can appear in minor versions, aka [The Terraform Model](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) so pin to minor.
   - stabilize API
   - set up any code quality and release tooling such as [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com), [Mergify](https://mergify.io), [CodeQL](https://securitylab.github.com/tools/codeql), etc.
   - transition to TypeScript
3. Publish a 1.0 and follow [semver](https://semver.org/).
